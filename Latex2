\begin{abstract}
LaTeX is a document preparation system for typesetting documents. It is widely used for creating various types of documents, including research papers, reports, and presentations. A LaTeX file (.tex) is created using any text editor such as Vim, Emacs, or Gedit. Additionally, there are many LaTeX Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) available, such as Kile and TexStudio.
